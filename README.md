# liri-node-app

Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp week 10 assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, we will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node.js app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, we will need to send requests using the `axios` package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. These Node packages are crucial for this assignment.

[Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

We will use Axios to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)
